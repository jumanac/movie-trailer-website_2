This is the final project for the Programming Foundations with Python in Udacity.

All the python files, images and html markup files are stored within the same folder.  The main python file "entertainment_center.py" which creates all the "Movie" objects accesses these files using relative paths.

In order to run the website, you need to open the fresh_tomatoes.html file in a browser.  Please notice, this website has been configured as my personal movie website (JP's).

I laid out six of my favorite movies which I consider classics.  If you click the movie image, the trailer of the movie comes on.

The code has been neatly formatted and with enough comments to understand and explain its behavior.
